  'Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland',
  'Lewis Carroll',
  'A curious girl falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world of peculiar creatures.',
  'Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it. "What is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"

So she was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet. It flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it. Burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down. Alice found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well. Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end?

She landed with a thump in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked. Alice walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key. Alice quickly discovered a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage. She knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains! But she could not even get her head through the doorway.

Going back to the table, she found a little bottle with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in large letters. Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, she very soon finished it off. "What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I must be shutting up like a telescope!" And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high.

But alas! When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it. Poor Alice! She sat down and cried.

After a while, she noticed a little glass box lying under the table. She opened it and found a very small cake, on which the words "EAT ME" were beautifully marked in currants. "Well, I''ll eat it," said Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key."

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected. Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling. She went on growing and growing, until she had to kneel down on the floor. She tried the little door again, but it was much too small for her now.

Poor Alice! All she could do was lie down on her side to look through into the garden with one eye. To get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her.

After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other.

"Oh, the Duchess, the Duchess!" the Rabbit muttered to itself. "Won''t she be savage if I''ve kept her waiting!" Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of anyone. The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and scurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.',

  'The Secret Garden',
  'Frances Hodgson Burnett',
  'A lonely orphan discovers a hidden garden and transforms both the garden and herself.',
  'When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.

Mary had never cared for anyone, and no one had ever cared for her. When her parents died from cholera, she was sent to England to live with her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, at his estate on the Yorkshire moors.

The house was a strange place—large, gloomy, and filled with hundreds of rooms. Mr. Craven was hardly ever there, lost in his grief over his wife''s death. Mary was left to wander the grounds alone, with only the servants for company.

One day, a friendly robin led Mary to a hidden door in the garden wall. Behind it lay a secret garden that had been locked and forgotten for ten years—ever since Mrs. Craven''s death. The garden was overgrown and appeared dead, but Mary could see tiny shoots of green beginning to push through the earth.

With the help of Dickon, a local boy with a gift for befriending animals, Mary began to secretly restore the garden. As she worked in the fresh air and sunshine, her pale cheeks grew rosy, and her sour expression transformed into something approaching happiness.

Then Mary discovered another secret: her cousin Colin, Mr. Craven''s son, who she hadn''t known existed. Colin had been kept hidden in the manor, convinced he was going to die young like his mother. He was a difficult, spoiled boy who threw terrible tantrums.

Mary, having been disagreeable herself, wasn''t intimidated by Colin''s behavior. She told him firmly that there was nothing wrong with him except his imagination. Gradually, she convinced him to visit the secret garden.

The transformation was remarkable. In the garden, Colin discovered he could walk and even run. The children worked together, planting flowers and watching them grow. As the garden came back to life, so did the children. Colin''s health improved dramatically, and his father''s sadness began to lift.

When Mr. Craven finally returned to Misselthwaite Manor, he heard children''s laughter coming from the secret garden. There he found Colin—not the sickly, bedridden boy he had left behind, but a healthy, happy child running through the flowers. The garden had worked its magic on them all.',

  'The Hobbit',
  'J.R.R. Tolkien',
  'A reluctant hobbit joins dwarves on a quest to reclaim their treasure from a dragon.',
  'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

Bilbo Baggins was a respectable hobbit who enjoyed his comfortable life in the Shire. He loved his warm home, his pantry full of food, and his peaceful existence. Adventure? Excitement? Hobbits had no use for such things.

But one day, the wizard Gandalf arrived at Bilbo''s door with thirteen dwarves. Their leader, Thorin Oakenshield, explained that they were on a quest to reclaim their homeland and treasure from Smaug, a fearsome dragon. They needed a burglar, and Gandalf had recommended Bilbo.

Despite his protests, Bilbo found himself swept up in the adventure. The journey was perilous from the start. The company was captured by trolls, who wanted to eat them, but Gandalf saved them by keeping the trolls arguing until sunrise turned them to stone.

In the Misty Mountains, they were caught by goblins and brought deep underground. During his escape, Bilbo became separated from the others and stumbled into a dark cave. There, he found a strange ring lying on the ground and put it in his pocket.

In that cave, Bilbo also met Gollum, a slimy creature who lived on an island in an underground lake. They played a riddle game, with Bilbo''s life as the stakes. Bilbo won by accident, asking "What have I got in my pocket?" Gollum couldn''t answer and was furious.

When Bilbo put on the ring he had found, he discovered it made him invisible. This allowed him to escape Gollum and find his way out of the mountains. He reunited with the dwarves and Gandalf, though he didn''t tell them the full truth about how he escaped.

The journey continued through many dangers: giant spiders in Mirkwood Forest, imprisonment by Wood-elves, and a tense journey to the Lonely Mountain where Smaug the dragon awaited. Bilbo, using his ring and his growing courage, managed to sneak into the mountain and speak with the dragon.

In his pride, Smaug revealed a weak spot in his armor. When the dragon attacked the nearby town of Lake-town in revenge, a brave archer named Bard used this information to slay the beast with a single arrow.

But the dragon''s death led to a new crisis. Men, elves, and dwarves all claimed the treasure, and war seemed inevitable. It was only when an army of goblins and wolves attacked that the various armies united to fight their common enemy. In the Battle of Five Armies, many brave warriors fell, including Thorin.

Before he died, Thorin made peace with Bilbo, recognizing that the hobbit''s simple wisdom about the value of home and friendship was worth more than all the treasure in the mountain. Bilbo returned to the Shire, carrying only a small portion of his share, along with the ring and memories of his great adventure.

Back in his comfortable hobbit-hole, Bilbo was changed. He was no longer considered quite respectable by other hobbits, but he didn''t mind. He had stories to tell, songs to sing, and he had learned that there was more to life than comfort and respectability. Sometimes, even the smallest person can change the course of the future.',

  'Animal Farm',
  'George Orwell',
  'Farm animals rebel against their human owner, only to find themselves under a new tyranny.',
  'Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop-holes. The animals of the farm were restless. Old Major, a prize-winning boar, had called a meeting in the big barn to share a strange dream.

"Comrades," Old Major began, "I have lived a long life, and I have come to understand the nature of our existence. We animals work and produce, yet we are given barely enough to keep us alive. All our labor is stolen by Man, who produces nothing yet lives in luxury. We must rebel!"

Three days later, Old Major died, but his words had planted a seed. The rebellion came sooner than anyone expected. Mr. Jones, drunk and neglectful, forgot to feed the animals. Driven by hunger, they broke into the store-shed. Jones and his men tried to whip them back, but this time the animals fought back. Within minutes, the humans were fleeing for their lives.

The animals could hardly believe their victory. Manor Farm was theirs! They renamed it Animal Farm and created Seven Commandments, the most important being "All animals are equal." Two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, emerged as leaders.

At first, the farm thrived. The animals worked hard, motivated by the knowledge that they were working for themselves. Snowball planned to build a windmill that would bring electricity and make their lives easier. But Napoleon opposed the plan. When it came time to vote, Napoleon unleashed nine fierce dogs he had secretly trained, and Snowball fled for his life.

Napoleon declared himself leader and announced that the windmill would be built after all—claiming it had been his idea from the start. The animals worked harder than ever, with the loyal cart-horse Boxer driving himself to exhaustion with his motto: "I will work harder!"

But gradually, things changed. The pigs moved into the farmhouse and began sleeping in beds. When the animals protested, they found the Commandments had been altered: "No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets." The pigs began trading with neighboring farms—the very humans they had rebelled against.

When the windmill was destroyed in a storm, Napoleon blamed Snowball and used this as an excuse to purge the farm of supposed traitors. Animals who confessed to crimes they hadn''t committed were slaughtered by the dogs. The Commandment "No animal shall kill any other animal" was found to read "without cause."

Boxer worked himself to collapse. When he fell, Napoleon promised to send him to a veterinarian, but the van that arrived was from a horse slaughterer. Squealer, Napoleon''s propagandist, convinced the animals that their eyes had deceived them.

Years passed. The farm was prosperous, but only the pigs and dogs lived well. The other animals worked harder than ever for less food than they had under Jones. One evening, the animals peeked through the farmhouse window and saw the pigs walking on two legs, wearing clothes, and playing cards with human farmers.

The Commandments had all been replaced with a single statement: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." Looking from pig to man, and man to pig, the animals found it impossible to tell which was which. The revolution had come full circle.',

  'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer',
  'Mark Twain',
  'A mischievous boy''s adventures along the Mississippi River, from whitewashing fences to witnessing a murder.',
  '"TOM!"

No answer.

"TOM!"

No answer.

"What''s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!"

Aunt Polly was calling, but Tom Sawyer was already climbing out the window. He had been caught with jam on his face, and he wasn''t about to face punishment. Tom was a clever boy who lived with his Aunt Polly in the small town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, along the Mississippi River.

Tom was always in trouble, but he had a way of turning every punishment into an adventure. When Aunt Polly sentenced him to whitewash the fence on Saturday, Tom convinced the other boys that painting was a privilege, not a chore. By afternoon, the fence had three coats of whitewash, and Tom had accumulated an apple, a kite, a dead rat on a string, and other treasures—all traded by boys who paid for the honor of painting his fence.

Tom fell in love with Becky Thatcher, the new girl in town, though their romance was rocky. He attended Sunday school only to win a Bible by trading for tickets, and he made a spectacle of himself in church by releasing a pinch-bug that fought with a poodle during the sermon.

But Tom''s life took a dark turn one night when he and his friend Huckleberry Finn, the town outcast, went to the graveyard at midnight to cure warts with a dead cat. There, they witnessed a murder. Injun Joe killed Dr. Robinson and framed the innocent Muff Potter for the crime. Terrified, Tom and Huck swore in blood never to tell what they saw.

Feeling troubled and unappreciated, Tom ran away with Huck and their friend Joe Harper to become pirates on Jackson''s Island. For several days, they lived freely, swimming, fishing, and exploring. Back in town, everyone believed the boys had drowned. But on the day of their funeral, Tom couldn''t resist the dramatic moment—the three "dead" boys walked into the church just as the service was beginning.

Tom''s conscience tortured him about Muff Potter''s trial. Finally, despite his fear of Injun Joe, Tom testified in court, revealing the truth about the murder. Muff Potter was freed, but Injun Joe escaped through a window.

Later, Tom and Becky got lost in McDougal''s Cave during a picnic. For three terrifying days, they wandered the dark passages with only a small candle. Tom discovered that Injun Joe was also hiding in the cave. Finally, Tom found an exit, and he and Becky were rescued.

Becky''s father, Judge Thatcher, ordered the cave sealed to prevent further accidents. Two weeks later, Tom revealed that Injun Joe was still inside. When they opened the cave, they found the villain dead, starved and trying to dig through the door.

Tom and Huck returned to the cave and found the treasure that Injun Joe had hidden—twelve thousand dollars in gold coins. The money was invested for them, giving them an income that made them rich by the standards of the town.

Huck was adopted by the Widow Douglas, who tried to "civilize" him with regular baths, proper clothes, and school. Huck found civilization suffocating and ran away. Tom found him and convinced him to give it another try—at least for a while. After all, Huck couldn''t be in Tom''s new gang of robbers unless he was respectable.

As summer ended, Tom and Huck looked forward to new adventures, knowing that nothing could keep them from finding trouble and excitement in the sleepy town of St. Petersburg.',

  'The Great Gatsby',
  'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
  'A mysterious millionaire throws lavish parties while pursuing an impossible dream of the past.',
  'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice. "Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven''t had the advantages that you''ve had."

I am Nick Carraway, and in the summer of 1922, I moved to West Egg, Long Island, to learn the bond business. My small house sat next to a mansion owned by a man named Jay Gatsby, about whom the most extraordinary rumors circulated.

Across the bay in East Egg lived my cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. Tom was a brutal, arrogant man from an immensely wealthy family. Daisy was beautiful and charming, but there was a desperation in her voice, a hint that she was deeply unhappy.

At their house, I met Jordan Baker, a professional golfer and friend of Daisy''s. Jordan told me that Tom was having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, whose husband ran a garage in the valley of ashes—a desolate stretch of land between West Egg and New York City.

My neighbor Gatsby threw spectacular parties every weekend. Hundreds of people came to drink his champagne and dance to his jazz orchestra, but few knew anything about their host. Some said he was a German spy. Others claimed he had killed a man.

One day, Gatsby''s chauffeur brought me a surprisingly formal invitation to one of these parties. There, I finally met my mysterious neighbor. Gatsby was elegant and gracious, with an extraordinary smile. But something about him seemed false, rehearsed.

Jordan revealed Gatsby''s secret: five years earlier, when he was a poor soldier, he had fallen in love with Daisy. She had promised to wait for him, but she married Tom instead. Everything Gatsby had done since—earning his fortune, buying his mansion, throwing his parties—was designed to win Daisy back. The green light at the end of Daisy''s dock, which Gatsby stared at each night, represented his yearning for the past.

Gatsby asked me to invite Daisy to tea, giving him a chance to "accidentally" meet her. Their reunion was awkward at first, but soon the old feelings returned. They began an affair, with Gatsby convinced that Daisy would leave Tom.

One hot summer day, the group went to New York. In a hotel room, Tom confronted Gatsby. He exposed Gatsby''s criminal connections—his fortune came from bootlegging and other illegal activities. Daisy, torn between her past and her present, couldn''t bring herself to leave Tom.

On the drive back, Daisy was driving Gatsby''s car when it struck and killed Myrtle Wilson, who had run into the road. Gatsby took the blame to protect Daisy.

Myrtle''s husband, mad with grief and believing Gatsby was driving, shot Gatsby and then himself. Gatsby died still believing that Daisy would call, that they would run away together. But she never called. She and Tom left town, leaving no forwarding address.

Almost no one came to Gatsby''s funeral—not the hundreds who had enjoyed his parties, not the business associates who had used him, and certainly not Daisy. I arranged everything and then left New York, disgusted by the carelessness of the wealthy.

Gatsby believed in the green light, in the future that year by year receded before him. He had an extraordinary gift for hope, and he died still reaching for his dream. "So we beat on," I reflected, "boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."',
